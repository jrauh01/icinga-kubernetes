# Start only these clusters automatically via init script.
# Allowed values are "all", "none" or a space separated list 
# of names of the clusters. If empty, "all" is assumed.
# The cluster name refers to the cluster environment file name.
# i.e. "cluster1" would be /etc/icinga-kubernetes/cluster1.env
#
# Changing this variable will require running "systemctl daemon-reload" 
# followed by a restart of the icinga-kubernetes service (if you 
# removed entries you may have to stop those manually)
#
#AUTOSTART="all"
#AUTOSTART="none"
#AUTOSTART="cluster1 cluster2"
